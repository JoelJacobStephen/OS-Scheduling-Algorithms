            <p class="priority-only">In Priority scheduling, there is a priority number assigned to each process. In
                some systems, the lower
                the number, the higher the priority. While, in the others, the higher the number, the higher will be the
                priority. The Process with the higher priority among the available processes is given the CPU. There are
                two types of priority scheduling algorithm exists. One is Preemptive priority scheduling while the other
                is Non Preemptive Priority scheduling.</p>

            <p class="robin-only">Round Robin scheduling algorithm is one of the most popular scheduling algorithm which
                can actually be implemented in most of the operating systems. This is the preemptive version of first
                come first serve scheduling. The Algorithm focuses on Time Sharing. In this algorithm, every process
                gets executed in a cyclic way. A certain time slice is defined in the system which is called time
                quantum. Each process present in the ready queue is assigned the CPU for that time quantum, if the
                execution of the process is completed during that time then the process will terminate else the process
                will go back to the ready queue and waits for the next turn to complete the execution.</p>

            <p class="fcfs-only">First come first serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm simply schedules the jobs according
                to their arrival time. The job which comes first in the ready queue will get the CPU first. The lesser
                the arrival time of the job, the sooner will the job get the CPU. FCFS scheduling may cause the problem
                of starvation if the burst time of the first process is the longest among all the jobs.</p>

            <p class="sjf-only">In SJF scheduling, the process with the lowest burst time, among the list of available
                processes in the ready queue, is going to be scheduled next.

                However, it is very difficult to predict the burst time needed for a process hence this algorithm is
                very difficult to implement in the system.</p>
